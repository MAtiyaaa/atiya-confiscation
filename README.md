# Description
* **Simple drag-and-drop.**

* **Made for those times when a police officer needs to confiscate an item off a player, or an officer needs to give the player back their items. The officer can use the command to store the items in a locker, and the player can go receive it at the location you choose in the config. No more 911 calls to reclaim items.**
